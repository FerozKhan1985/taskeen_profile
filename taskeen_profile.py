- **GPA:** `3.9`
- **Research thesis entitled:** `Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from novel Bischofia Javanica plant loaded chitosan hydrogel: as antimicrobial and wound healing agent.`  
- **Thesis Summary:**  
The current study aimed to develop a new anti-bacterial approach that would surpass antibiotics in therapeutics and will efficiently deal with diverse nature of microbes. The study comprised of synthesis of Ag nano particles using green synthesis technology and its characterization by XRD, FTIR and SEM. Biochemical identificatio  o  bacteria  species  anti-microbia  susceptibilit  profie,  anti-bifilm  ssay and application of Ag nano particles on wound healing in rat model. NPs were applied on burnt wound of rat model and its activity was recorded up to 21 days. A good epithelialization was achieved, as well as a strong wound closure. In comparison to chitosan, silver nanoparticles incorporating membranes demonstrated a high amount of angiogenesis and speedy wound healing

- GPA: `3.21`
- **Research thesis entitled:** ` Molecular detection of Active HCV in Peshawar ( April-Dec 2017 )"`  
- **Thesis Summary:**  
  Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a blood-borne virus that infects the liver, affects an estimated 4 million Americans, with 3.2 million chronically infected. A study looking at HCV prevalence among 221 people (mostly men) aged 18-80 found a higher infection rate in males (11%) compared to females (8%). The study also showed the highest infection rate (16.41%) in those aged 41-60, with no infections detected in the 10-20 age group. These findings highlight the need for an HCV vaccine to prevent infection, especially considering that behaviors like unsafe drug use and unclean medical instruments can spread the virus.

- Worked on Bio-synthesis of novel nanomaterials as Antimicrobial, Anticancer and wound healing agent.
- Developing metallic nanoparticles (Ag, Fe, Cu) for diverse applications.
- The current study has made a solution to antibiotic resistance by determining the individual and combined efficacies of nanoparticles and antibiotics.
- The study has found that nanoparticles or their combination with antibiotics is a potential alternative way to solve microbial resistance problems.
- In addition, mixing a hydrogel matrix with AgNPs provides considerable wound-healing and antimicrobial activity.
- Concluded that AgNPs should be a selective therapeutic in the field of medicine
- Expected results were obtained from experiments that were performed.
- Published research findings and presented at conferences
